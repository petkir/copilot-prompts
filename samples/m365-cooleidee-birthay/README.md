# Coole Idea Bithady Presenrt

<!--
This is how you want the sample to appear in the samples browser.
When naming your sample, try to give it a friendly name that describes what it does. Explain in which copilot experience (Microsoft 365, GitHub Copilot, Copilot for Word, etc.) to use the prompt.

GOOD 👍:
  Prompt for Copilot for Microsoft 365 showing how to catch up with recent team activities.
BAD 👎:
  prompt-summary
-->

## Summary

Short summary on the contents of the sample. What does the prompt help the user achieve? In which copilot experience is it meant to be used?

<!--
Please provide a high-quality screenshot of the prompt in action. Include a screenshot of the prompt and its outcome.

Upload the image in a subfolder named `assets`. Use a resolution of 1920x1080.

You can add multiple screenshots to help users understand your samples without having to download  and install it.
